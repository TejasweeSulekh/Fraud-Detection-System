# Fraud-Detection-System

This project is a full-stack application designed to detect potentially fraudulent transactions using a rule-based engine. It features a Python backend API built with FastAPI, a PostgreSQL database for data persistence, and a simple vanilla JavaScript frontend for interaction. The entire application is containerized using Docker for easy setup and deployment.
